# Airplane Fatalities Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of global airplane accidents, with a focus on identifying patterns and insights related to fatalities. The goal is to understand trends in aviation safety over time, highlight factors that contribute to higher fatality rates, and uncover insights regarding airline operators, geographic locations, and temporal patterns in accidents.

The analysis uses Python along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to manipulate the data, perform statistical analysis, and create meaningful visualizations. Visualizations include trends over years, fatality distributions by airline and country, and heatmaps of accident occurrences.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Kaggle: Aviation Accident Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airplane-crashes-and-fatalities)
- **Time Span**: Data spans from 1908 to 2009.
- **Key Columns**:
  - `Date`: Date of the accident.
  - `Operator`: Airline or operator involved.
  - `Fatalities`: Number of fatalities.
  - `Location`: City or country where the accident occurred.
  - `Aboard`: Number of people aboard the aircraft.
  - `Ground`: Number of fatalities on the ground.

## 🧪 Analysis & Visualizations

### 1. Temporal Trends

- **Accident Frequency Over Time**: Counts the number of accidents per year to observe historical trends.
- **Fatalities Over Time**: Tracks total fatalities per year to identify years with unusually high fatalities.

### 2. Operator Analysis

- **Top Operators by Fatalities**: Highlights airlines with the highest number of fatalities.
- **Accident Count by Operator**: Shows which operators have experienced the most accidents.

### 3. Geographical Insights

- **Accident Locations**: Maps and lists accident occurrences by country or region.
- **Fatalities by Location**: Compares total fatalities across different countries.

### 4. Flight & Fatality Details

- **People Aboard vs. Fatalities**: Examines how many people were on board vs. fatalities in each accident.
- **Ground Fatalities**: Analyzes incidents where people on the ground were affected.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical calculations.
